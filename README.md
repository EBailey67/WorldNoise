# WorldNoise
Noise generator based on some industry standards to be utilized for procedural world generation

I'm attempting to write a detailed procedural world generator, and I'm forking the 
Accidental Noise Library by JTippet so I can cross-compile on Linux and update to
match the latest C++ standards.
